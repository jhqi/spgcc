This is the code for Superpixel Graph Contrastive Clustering with Semantic-Invariant Augmentations for Hyperspectral Images.

We have uploaded the pretrained embeddings of India Pines and Salinas. Since the file of Pavia University is too big, plz download from: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1s74mpjHNNwB8nwZ6qXlSZg?pwd=1234

To reproduce
1. unzip the pretrained embeddings under "pretrained_emb"
2. python train_SA.py
